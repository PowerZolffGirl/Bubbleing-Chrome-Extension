Cut the potatoes in half if your potatoes are bigger than a small egg.\n\n2. Preheat a large (shallow) braising pot over medium high heat. Add some oil (1 Tbsp) and spread it well. Add the potatoes and drizzle more oil (1 Tbsp) over them. Pan fry the potatoes over medium heat for about 25 mins. Turn them around often to avoid burning. Alternatively, you could roast the potatoes in the oven at 200 C / 392 F for 30 mins. I actually prefer oven roasting as it’s less hands on.\n\n3. Once the outer layer of potato is nicely cooked and browned, add the water and the braising sauce. Bring it to boil over medium high heat (about 2 mins).

Place beef, carrot, yellow pickled radish strip, a few egg strips, and spinach in the center of the rice.\n3. Use both hands to roll the mat (along with gim and rice) over the fillings, so one edge of the rice and gim reaches the opposite edge. This centers the fillings in the roll, so they’ll be nicely in the middle when you slice it.\n4. Grab the mat with both hands and and press it tightly as you continue rolling the gimbap. Push out the mat as you roll, so it doesn’t get wrapped in the gimbap.\n5. Remove the roll from the mat at the end and set the finished roll aside with the seam down, to seal it nicely.\n6. Repeat 4 more times with the remaining ingredients.\n7. Put some toasted sesame oil on the finshed rolls and sprinkle some sesame seeds over top. Cut each roll into ¼ inch bite size pieces with a sharp knife, occasionally wiping it with a wet paper towel or cloth to clean the starch off and to ease cutting.\n8.

Put the cleaned pig’s trotter on your cutting board. Pat dry with a kitchen towel or paper towel and shave any remaining hair with a razor.\n4. Bring a large pot of water to a boil (I used my 6½ quart soup pot). Add the pig’s trotter and 1 tablespoon of thinly sliced ginger. Cover and boil for 20 to 25 minutes over medium high heat, until vigorously boiling. You’ll see some dark brownish foam floating around the trotter and the water will look grayish.\n5. Remove from the heat. Strain the trotter and wash it in cold water with a kitchen brush. Wash the pot nicely, too. Put the pot back on the stove and put the pig’s trotter inside.\n\nFill the pouch and cook:\n1. Add the ingredients to the pouch, tie the end tightly and add it to the pot next to the clean trotter.\n2. Add 10 cups of water to the pot along with doenjang, mirim, soy sauce, dark brown sugar, kosher salt, and rice syrup.\n3. Cover and cook 1 hour over medium high heat.\n4. Uncover and turn over the trotter. Press the pouch down a couple of times with a wooden spoon.\n5. Reduce the heat to medium, cover, and cook another hour.\n6. Open and check to see if the meat is well cooked by poking it with a stainless steel chopstick or a long wooden skewer. If it goes through smoothly and the meat is almost falling off the bones, it’s well cooked. If not, cook longer and add more water as needed.\n7. Turn up the heat to high heat and cook another 10 minutes with the lid off, ladling broth from the bottom of the pot over top of the trotter. The broth will evaporate a little and the trotter will get browner and shinier.\n8. Take out the trotter and put it on the cutting board. Let it cool for 10 to 20 minutes until you can handle it.',

Prepare saltwater solution of ½ cup course, non-iodized salt and 1 gallon cold water inlarge mixing bowl.\nb. Dip cabbage pieces briefly in the saltwater solution, to facilitate penetration of salt into thecabbage pieces. Discard saltwater solution.\nc. Drain and place cabbage pieces in a bowl. Sprinkle 1 cup of course, non-iodized salt over the cut cabbage and massage it into the cabbage well. Allow cabbage to sit covered at room temperature for 3 to 6 hours (a longer time will make it more salty).\nd.

Pack kimchi tightly into container, minimizing air exposure and encouraging brine formation. Fill container about 2/3rd full, as fermenting microorganisms will release carbon dioxide(CO2) and create bubbling and fizzing.\nb. Cover tightly. If using jars, seal to finger-tip tight. If using bags, squeeze out excess air. Place on plate or in bowl to catch potential overflow.\n\n5. Ferment!\nOption 1: Kimchi may be placed in refrigerator so it ferments slowly over 3 to 4 days. This may be preferred, especially during hot weather.\nOption 2: Place sealed container in a well-ventilated location (may become pungent), with a relatively constant room temperature, around 68° F is ideal. Ferment only 1 to 2 days at room temperature, tasting it daily until it reaches preferred tangy taste and desired texture.',

Combine hot pepper paste, hot pepper flakes, and sugar in a small bowl. Remove the anchovies and kelp from the pot and add the rice cake, the mixture in the bowl, the green onion, and the optional fish cakes and hard boiled eggs. The stock will be about 2½ cups.\n\n4. Stir gently with a wooden spoon when it starts to boil. Keep stirring until the rice cake turns soft and the sauce thickens and looks shiny, which should take about 10 -15 minutes. If the rice cake is not soft enough, add more water and continue stirring until soften. When you use freshly made rice cake, it takes shorter time. If you use frozen rice cake, thaw it out and soak in cold water to soften it before cooking.\n\n5. Remove from the heat and serve hot.',

    how: '1. Heat 2 cups of oil in a shallow pot over medium-high heat.\n\n2. Meanwhile, prepare everything else. Let’s make the batter first. In a medium bowl, whisk together the following: 1½ cups Korean Frying Mix (150g), ½ cup COLD water + 3 ice cubes (the batter needs to be very COLD at all times!) Whisk until you get a a runny texture that is not too thin nor too thick. Refrigerate, as we slice up the vegetables next (10 minutes).\n\n3. Chop and slice the following vegetables into strips: 2 small potatoes, peeled (keep it submerged in water until it’s ready to be dunked in the batter, otherwise it’ll brown), 1 medium carrot, 1 brown onion (save 2 Tbsp of chopped onions for the dip), 4-5 green onions (save 1.5 Tbsp of chopped green onions for the dip)\n\n4. Take the batter out of the refrigerator. Strain your sliced potatoes out of the water. Add your sliced vegetables to the batter (not all at once), and thoroughly mix and add more until all vegetables are all coated in the batter. Do this by handfuls— you want to make sure there is enough batter to cover all vegetables. Add in ½ tsp white sugar and salt. Mix.\n\n5. Pinch of salt Fry it up now! Using a tong, pick up a variety of all the veggies you sliced. Carefully drop it into the oil. Don’t overcrowd your frying pot. We added 3-4 bunches at a time, but it varies on how big your pot is. Let it fry for 3-4 minutes, giving it a flip when it turns just golden and crispy on one side. Once crispy on both sides, let the oils drain a bit on a cooling rack with a paper towel underneath.',
